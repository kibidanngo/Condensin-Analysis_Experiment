# Condensin-Analysis_Experiment
The main file (*functions_Nat.com.nb*) is a Mathematica notebook (version 12.1.0.0) containing the results used to analyze the experimental data: Loop extrusion velocity Ω, Ω with ATP concentration,  P(L|R), P(L|R,f), P(ΔL), and P(ΔL,f). For the details of the equations, see the main text. 

The raw digitized data from the loop extrusion experiments used in the main text and the Supplementary Information are included.  
*Ganji_rate_extension_all.dat*: Loop extrusion velocity from Ganji et al.(2018,Science). 

*hirano_dist.dat*: Distribution of loop extrusion length from Strick et al. (2004,Current biology).

*hist_Ryu_f02.dat* ~ *hist_Ryu_f10.dat*: Distributions of loop extrusion length for a given f(external load) value from Ryu et al.(2020,biorxiv).
