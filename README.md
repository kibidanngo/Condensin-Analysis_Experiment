# Condensin-Analysis_Experiment
The main file (functions_Nat.com.nb) is a Mathematica notebook containing the results used to analyze experimental data: Loop extrusion velocity Ω, Ω with ATP concentration,  P(L|R), P(L|R,f), P(ΔL), and P(ΔL,f). For the details of the equations, see the main text. 
The raw discretized data from the loop extrusion experiments (Ganji et al.(2018), Ryu et al.(2020), and Strick et al (2004)) are included.
